4.2
the chi square before obtaining the off set is 2.318e+06. 

4.3
the off set which minimizes the chi square is 27.3926

the corrected chi square after introducing the correction is 177.643. 
if we take the off set and model distance modulus to be free parameters, and have 156 data points, the reduced chi square is 177.643/154 = 1.15.
This is a pretty good model! The deviations from the data are well explained by the uncertainty in the data.

This shows the chi square surface

4.5
please see Rel_Prob.png
This figure shows the relative probability of our model given the Super Nova data. 
The probability has been projected down into the xy plane for clarity.
By inspection, the maximum likelihood corresponds to a universe with omega lambda ~ .3 and omega m ~.1. This is close to the recipe we used in 4.1

For greater detail, pleas see confidence_reg.png
This is the likelihood projected down into the xy plane, with 68% and 95.4% confidence regions highlighted in white.
The Maximum likelihood is indicated by a red star, and red vertical and horizontal lines indicate the parameters corresponding to the maximum likelihood

The Maximum likelihood corresponds to omega m = .0856, omega l = .3026. Taking h to be .65, this gives omega k =0.034
We can contrast this with our first model where omega m = .11, omega l = .304 and omega k = 0.
Looking at the confidence regions, these results are still consistent with each other to within 1 sigma
